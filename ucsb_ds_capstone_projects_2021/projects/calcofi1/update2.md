# Update 2

## Project Introduction
- CALCOFI is an organization tasked with studying the marine environment of coastal California and investigating the relationships between climate, fish population, and other human activities.
- Our project focuses on two separate information sets: fish larvae catch data from CALCOFI cruises intended to measure populations of various species, and commercial fish data from fisheries in California.
- We are seeking to establish whether any correlation can be drawn from the two datasets, as well as possibly investigate any environmental factors that add variance to the relationship.

## Summary of Datasets
- Larvae Dataset
    - A column for times, and one for every species caught
    - Very sparse dataset, since most of the cruises caught 0 of a particular species
- Commercial Fishery Dataset
    - Columns for time, location, and which species was caught
    - Species are in common, rather than scientific, names so need to be converted
    - Also column for total price and pounds caught of fish
        - However, because of data privacy, much of the price/pounds are redacted (if there were very few cruises that month).
        - We are investigating whether we can aggregate the data by using coarser spatial resolution in order to get more accurate catch information
- Block Grouping Dataset
    - Contains total price and total pounds caught for each species, by year
    - Also contains basic information about location of each catch



## Part 1: Exploring Correlations

In our last progress update, we took a brief look at the visual relationship between the larvae and the fishery catch. Now that we got more refined data, we noticed strong correlation with certain fish, such as pacific sardine:

At this point, we wanted to explore the possibility of a more causal relationship. We decided to calculate the correlation of Larva_(t) and Fish_(t+x), with x being between (-2, 7).  This way, it would give us a better look if, for example, a higher larvae count 2-4 years ago could potentially predict a higher fishery catch later. We performed a basic linear correlation on the offset data, generating the following graph:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gavintieng/ucsb-ds-capstone-2021.github.io/main/ucsb_ds_capstone_projects_2021/projects/calcofi1/update2_final.png" alt="drawing" />

As we can see, several fish (anchovy and opah) hold almost no correlation regardless of the year offset. Northern Anchovy had a moderately strong negative correlation, which was rather unexpected, and something that we will need to investigate further in the future. Most importantly, however, the fish with the highest correlations (both mackarels and the sardine) do seem to have higher correlations when offsetted by several years, around the typical lifespans of the fish. This is a very promising piece of information! It seems to support our initial hypothesis that if we see more larvae present, then in a few years, we will see more adult fish.

The logical next steps would be to now explore performing some significance tests between the two correlations to see if they differ by a statistically significant amount, or purely by random chance. Additionally, we want to explore whether evaluating a possible Granger causality between the two datasets to more rigorously validate our initial conclusions. Either way, we were quite excited about finding any such relationship in the data, even if it is only moderately strong.

Then, we continued to explore correlations by investigating the following:

### a) Price Per Pound vs. Catch Pounds

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gavintieng/ucsb-ds-capstone-2021.github.io/main/ucsb_ds_capstone_projects_2021/projects/calcofi1/beforeafterppp.png" alt="drawing" style="width:700px;"/>

These graphs showcases the correlation between the price/pound of each individual fish
compared with how many fish were caught that specific year. In addition, this compares
the graphs produced by the old dataset (left) with our new dataset (right), which draws
a conclusion that the new dataset showcases a clearer relationship between the two
features. The new dataset now reveals that all fish has a negative correlation when 
comparing price/pound and total catch, with Anchovy, Opah, and Sardine showing that 
their correlation is significant enough that this did not happen through chance. Thus,
we can draw a inference where the more fish that is caught in a singular year, the 
lower the price of each individual fish is, which is something we couldn't conclude from
the original dataset due to some of the fish showcasing varying relationships and
correlations.

### b) Total Catch vs. Larvae Amounts
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gavintieng/ucsb-ds-capstone-2021.github.io/main/ucsb_ds_capstone_projects_2021/projects/calcofi1/CatchvsLarvae.png alt="drawing" style="width:700px;"/>

These graphs showcases the correlation between the total catch of an individual fish in
a single year versus how much larvae was seen that year. Not all the fish display the
same correlation or result, but when looking at sardine, we see that the correlation
between those two attributes are significant. Thus, we can infer from this that more
sardine was caught in a single year, likely explained by there being more adult sardine
to be caught. If that premise is true, then because there are more adult fish, more
adult fish would be laying more larvae, which explains why there is a positive 
correlatin between total catch and larvae count.

### c) Total Catch vs. Larvae Amounts (lagged)
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gavintieng/ucsb-ds-capstone-2021.github.io/main/ucsb_ds_capstone_projects_2021/projects/calcofi1/sardinelag.png alt="drawing" style="width:700px;"/>

Using the insight granted from the second graph, we plotted a graph showcasing a lagged
correlation between total catch and larvae amount. This is to see if there is a 
possibility on whether the amount of larvae that was seen would hatch out and become 
adults in the future to be caught. The graph showcases that there is a significant
result for a positive correlation where the more sardine larvae there is, the more 
fish that is to be caught in the future years because more fish are becoming adults
from those larvae. 

### d) Total Catch vs. Larvae Amounts (with years)

Additionally, we created plots that visualized the relationship between catch pounds and larvae amounts, with the associated year on each point. Our intention with these plots was to explore whether there was a relationship between a grouping of years that might influence the catch pounds. These graphs were reproduced for each of the 6 species.


## Part 2: Exploring the Effect of Extreme Weather Events

We also explored the relationship between fish larvae and extreme weather events, such as El Nino and La Nina. Since these weather events affect the warming and cooling of ocean temperatures, we wanted to see if they played a role in the amount of larvae found. 

<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gavintieng/ucsb-ds-capstone-2021.github.io/main/ucsb_ds_capstone_projects_2021/projects/calcofi1/elnino_mjack.png alt="drawing">

The plot above shows the average amount of mackerel jack fish larval found each year, along with lines that depict when an El Nino or La Nina event starts and ends. The goal was to identify trends during years with weather events.

Similar to the previous visualization, we created these weather event plots for each of the 6 fish species. Although it was difficult to see immediate trends, we plan on spending more time investigating the effect that these weather events have on fish larvae amounts. Ideally, we would be able to isolate certain years and see if changes in fish larvae are signiciant or not.

## Conclusion: Update 2

Since the first update, we have continued to focus on conducting exploratory analysis, with the intention of finding some meaningful correlations between larvae amounts and catch pounds. In the coming weeks, we plan on doing more exploratory analysis, and then deciding on a primary focus for the project.
