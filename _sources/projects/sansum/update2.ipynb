    "- Type 2 Diabetes (T2D): Type 2 diabetes is an impairment in the way the body regulates and uses sugar (glucose) as a fuel. This long-term (chronic) condition results in too much sugar circulating in the bloodstream. Eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems.\n",
    "- HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c): A minor component of hemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues) that binds with glucose. HbA1c blood tests are commonly used to measure average blood sugar levels and diagnose diabetes. HbA1c levels are given as a percentage of hemoglobin proteins that are coated with sugar. \n",

    "Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death among Latino Americans. Almost 1 in 2 Latino adults are at risk of type 2 diabetes. Recent data from the CDC shows that diabetes rates are twice as high for Latinos of Mexican heritage compared with Whites. This excess burden of diabetes is due to complex, poorly-understood interactions between determinants of health. Some of these include economic challenges, cultural/language/health literacy barriers, pollution, etc. Many of these factors are beyond traditional biological factors; by learning more about these relationships we can identify interventions that can target diabetes outside of traditional clinical options."

The vertical red bar indicates the point at which HbA1c = 7, giving a better view to the distribution of individuals with lower or higher values than 7. Surprisingly, the individuals not treated have lower HbA1c levels, having a skewed right distribution when compared to their treated counterparts. This could be due to the treated participants having a greater need for Insulin, or could be due to the lower number of participants being treated than not being treated."

The left plot displays participants treated for insulin during research, while the right plot displays the participants not treated for insulin during research. Both graphs have a solid red bar at the level HbA1c = 7, displaying the two groups used to categorize HbA1c so far in our research. As the years get closer to present day, there is a noticeable negative correlation between diagnosis and HbA1c for both graphs. While the treated group has a higher HbA1c levels for its slope, both groups seem to have a similar slope based on the angle of line depicted in each graph. When measuring the correlations for each group, the treated group had a correlation of -0.065, while the non-treated group had a correlation of -0.052. While separated, the two groups do not produce significant correlations, but when combined they produce a significant correlation with a value of -0.242."

    "FACIT-Sp-12 stands for “Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being 12 Item Scale”. There are three subscores when using the 3-Factor model: meaning, peace and faith. Higher scores imply better spiritual well being. These plots show the differences between the correlation and stratification of A1c in relation to both the FACIT-Sp-12 total score and subscores. \n",
    "These results were surprising to us because we expected a negative correlation between spiritual wellbeing and A1c if any, however the correlations between all scores were positive. It appears that most individuals had high faith scores, but that the meaning subscore actually increased a fair amount with A1c. This could possibly be because as the disease worsens, participants start to find ‘acceptance’ in the absence of initial shock. \n",
    "To explore this result more, we are planning to perform the same test when stratified by both diagnosis date and whether the participant was treated with insulin."
